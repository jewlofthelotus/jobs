npm is the package manager for JavaScript. We operate the world's
largest software repository and are used by more than 1 in 4
programmers worldwide. We occupy a central place in modern front-end
web development and our technology helps build all sorts of things
from mobile apps and desktop applications through robots to space
suits at NASA. We host over 540,000 open source software libraries,
and our more than 8.6 million users download more than 11 billion
packages from our servers every month. We are, as they say, kind of a
big deal.

We are looking for our first full-time internal team member dedicated
to managing our financial operations, reporting directly to the COO.
You'll be refining our business models and analyzing our business,
looking at every part of our company and advising the executive team
on planning, budgeting, and measuring success. Your goal will be to
give us a clear picture of our current state, and advise us on the
potential impacts of decisions we're considering. Our outsourced
accounting and payroll functions will report to you, and you will have
full control over those relationships, including whether to bring them
back in-house or change providers.

Some things we'll be asking you to do:

- Producing dashboards and reports for the company and the board
- Improving and expanding existing business models
- Define and track KPIs
- Plan and track budgets and expenses
- Ad-hoc analysis of our financial data to support investment theses
- Diligence documentation during funding events
- Ongoing compliance process and documentation

As the company grows, we expect you to grow with it, hiring a team
under you and turning manual processes into automated ones. We have
existing dashboards and data workflows but the tools you use will be
up to you. We think someone with a background in finance and
experience of working at startups will be the best fit for this
position, but we don't get hung up on academic credentials. We want
someone who loves bringing order to chaos, and is able to keep the big
picture in sight at all times.

Your work will impact millions of people, and you'll work with people
who truly value what you do.
