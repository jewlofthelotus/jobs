## Software Engineer at npm, Inc., in the services team, focusing on web services

npm is the world’s largest software repository, with 6M users and over 6 billion downloads every month. We’ve got big plans for 2017, adding new features to our website and registry that will let JavaScript developers work better and faster. For that we need creative, experienced engineers.

Services team members report to the services engineering manager and work alongside the services technical lead. Team members are responsible for maintaining and developing of npm services: the internal and external REST APIs & website, the services that store and manage the npm registry packages, and the billing & user management system. In this role, you’ll focus on npm’s web services, from CSS in the browser on down, as deep in the stack as you’re interested in going.

Team members build software, collaborate with coworkers, identify projects that require attention, and deploy the results. In addition, all of our developers are part of the on-call rotation, 1 day out of every 10, because we think being on call leads to more reliable software. (Our on-call rotation is during waking hours; overnight on-call is handled by a team in a better time zone.)

The services team values analysis, communication, action, sustainability, and reflection. We work collaboratively to find the best solutions to problems. We write constantly about what we do, both to improve our own thinking about it and to communicate with one another. We focus on tools and processes that support our work rather than on individual heroics.

Because the team is small, we also value flexibility, scrappy problem solving, and continual process improvements. We manage the largest package repository in the world, and take that responsibility seriously. If we don’t fix it, nobody else will.

As a candidate for this position, you are not expected to have experience with all aspects of the responsibilities listed above, nor are you expected to have a depth of particular experience with any of our tools. We have omitted specific technologies from this job description because we feel that skills and tools can (and will, by necessity!) be learned on the job. We do want you to be prepared to talk to us about a time you shipped code to users, whether that experience was good or bad.

Our headquarters are in Oakland, California. The services team has members in Oakland, Seattle, Portland, Brooklyn, and Poznan. If you have experience working remotely, so do we. We cannot currently sponsor new work visas other than TN-1s, but we can transfer existing H-1Bs.

Your work at npm will make every JavaScript developer in the world just a little bit faster, and a little bit happier. It’s a great feeling. We’d love to have you join us.

npm's mission is to take Open Source development to entirely new places. When everyone else is adding force, we work to reduce friction.

npm is not a typical product, and we are not a typical early-stage "work hard/play hard" startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests, who take our careers and our lives seriously. We believe that the best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another.

We aim for a sustainable approach to work and life, because that is the best way to maximize long-term speed, while retaining clarity of vision. Compassion is our strategy.
