npm, Inc. seeks a marketing operations associate to automate and optimize how we spread the word about the world’s largest software registry and the products and services we sell.

## About us

We’re kind of a big deal. Developers use npm, Inc.’s open source software and web registry to build, test, and share code more than 300 million times per day, and registry downloads have grown by more than 12x in the last two years. Our products and services offer additional ways to organize and share code and integrate npm with other tools. More than 30,000 companies, including the BBC, DocuSign, SiriusXM, Slack, and Visa, rely on npm to reduce friction and build amazing things.

But how do developers and their companies discover npm? How do we communicate what we have to offer? How do we make it easy to try, purchase, and love our things?

We need your help.

## About you

You’ll keep the marketing machine humming. Its moving parts include marketing automation, CRM, email marketing, web analytics, blog and editorial content, and ad tools.

You’ll also flex your creativity and zany generalism. Can you proofread this post? Re-scale that asset? Fix the fugly email template? Pitch new stickers and order more socks? If you’ve never done it before, can you fake it for a bit and see how far you get?

There are no firm requirements. We think we’re looking for prior experience in marketing, marketing operations, or comms, but that’s not rigid. If you are curious, adaptable, and kind, you can get the hang of this. Did you know our CEO started his career selling vacuum cleaners, and our head of marketing was an unsuccessful screenwriter? It takes all kinds. 

## About working here

We value communication, action, sustainability, and reflection. We work collaboratively to find the best solutions to problems. We focus on tools and processes rather than on individual heroics. We also value flexibility, continual process improvements, and scrappy problem solving. There is no job too big or too small for anyone here.

Our headquarters are in Oakland, California, but the revenue team has members in Oakland, New York, and Texas. If you have experience working remotely, so do we. We cannot currently sponsor new work visas other than TN-1s, but we can transfer existing H-1Bs.

npm is not a typical early-stage “work hard/play hard” startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests, who take our careers and our lives seriously. The best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another.

If you’ve read this far, you’re promisingly attentive, and you should apply. Mention that the magic word is _cupcakes_ and we’ll send you some swag or something.
