## Internships

If you're currently in full-time education (class of 2016 or 2017) and looking for a summer internship with an open-source project that can also pay you, we're happy to say that we can offer you a place at npm in partnership with our investors, as part of the [True Entrepreneur Corps](http://www.trueventures.com/tec/) program.

We are looking primarily for enthusiasm and intellectual curiosity, but any experience with JavaScript and especially Node.js is obviously a big advantage.

You'll be working on the open-source npm project itself, so your work will be code-reviewed by the same people who run the project, your commits will immediately benefit tens of thousands of active users, and will also be publicly verifiable by future employers.

Last year's intern, [Faiq](https://twitter.com/faiqus), wrote about [what he learned](http://www.trueventurestec.com/2014/06/26/some-useful-info-for-tech-interns/) on TEC's blog and also had this to say:

> Imagine working at a place with some of the best and kindest engineers, getting paid to write open source code, and being immersed in one of the most diverse developer communities ever. It sounds too good to be true, doesn't it? When you get a chance to work at npm, you'll be doing exactly that. Day to day, you'll get to work on challenging problems that push your limits as an engineer. You'll run into problems that'll seem impossible at first, but by the end of your internship will seem like a piece of cake! This internship is one of the most unique opportunities you'll get, so definitely give it a shot and apply!

Faiq worked on our website and search. Even after leaving npm, Faiq continues to be involved and has even [committed to npm core](https://github.com/npm/npm/commits/master?author=faiq). You can expect a similar range of opportunities, depending on your interests.

If you're interested, please send a brief email introducing yourself as well as a PDF or Google doc of your resume to [jobs@npmjs.com](mailto:jobs@npmjs.com) and include the word "internship" in your subject line. The internship is based out of our offices in Oakland, California. You must be part of the graduating class of 2016 or 2017 and legally able to work in the United States; we are not currently able to sponsor visa applications.
