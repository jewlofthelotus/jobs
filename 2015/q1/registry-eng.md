# Registry Engineer

The npm registry is on track to serve more than a billion package downloads a month, with peak traffic over 3200 requests per second. The registry is now robust and performant, and we have a new website and a faster, more reliable command-line client. This means we've been able to expand what we do, with the release of npm Enterprise last year and the upcoming release of private module support.

As part of the Registry team, you'll be working on a service used by millions of developers, and contributing to many of our open-source projects to do it. In 2015 that's going to include private modules, support for teams and organizations, and improvements to npm Enterprise.

We're looking for an experienced engineer who understands the importance of maintainable code and comprehensive tests, who values simple, composable services. We expect you to understand modern source control, and be a fan of deployment automation. We have a pragmatic approach to architectural and technology choices, and hope you will too.

Like all npm engineers, you'll be expected to handle operational tasks. We expect this role to be about 80% development, 20% operations, so you need to be actively interested in getting operational stuff right, because we take our uptime very seriously.

The majority of your output will be open source code and we actively encourage you to develop and release open-source tooling that helps the broader node.js community; anything that helps node users helps us.

We are accepting remote candidates for this role but will give precedence to candidates who are local to our offices in Oakland, California, or at least in a nearby time zone.
