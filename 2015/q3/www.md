## www Engineer

The site you're looking at right now has come a long way. Our hard-working www team has re-written it into [a whole new codebase](https://github.com/npm/newww), refactored old code, implemented a new design, and added a bunch of new features that are going to be released Any Moment Nowâ„¢ in support of [organizations](https://www.npmjs.com/orgs).

We get well over 6 million page views every month, and more people use us all of the time. The next year will see us building features that have long been on our roadmap like curation tools, package ecosystems, ever-improving search, interactive tutorials for new users, better package management, and access control systems for users, organizations and teams.

As you can see, there's a lot to do, and we're going to need a lot of help to do it. You'll be joining our existing team of three www engineers and a designer. More people means more focus, and juicier features for you to work on.

As a www engineer, you'll work on the full stack of our web app. That can mean working with our designer to build designs, defining and integrating new APIs, or improving performance, scalability, and security. We're working in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the browser, and the server components are written using node.js.

We're looking for somebody who is experienced enough to have a sense of good practices and can both help create new features and refactor existing code as our feature set continues to expand. Your code will be open source, so you'll get help from the community, as well as a voice in establishing the best practices for modern web development in node.js.

The team is geographically distributed, so we work using a mix of Slack, ScreenHero, Hangouts and other tools to help stay in touch and working together. We are open to remote and local candidates.
