# architect, www team

[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) is growing quickly, with a million unique visitors every month and over 5MM page views. Having given it a totally new look and overhauled the backend over the last year, we launched [private modules](https://www.npmjs.com/private-modules) in April.

Now we have a ton of ambitious plans for it, including team-management features,  [curation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#collections) and [programmatic validation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#ecosystems) of packages, better stats, and significantly better search. We also have our [npm Enterprise](https://www.npmjs.com/enterprise) product, which needs a web experience all of its own.

To oversee this expansion, we need a senior engineer capable of taking responsibility for the architecture of the site. Somebody who's been in the web space a long time, and has an instinct for the "right way" to build a website rather than "new way" or the "fashionable way".

You won't be managing the team -- that's somebody else's full-time job. Instead you'll be responsible for understanding the full www system and how it integrates with our other systems. You'll be the one making the cost-benefit decisions of different approaches to adding new functionality, and have the final say on all architectural decisions in the www codebase. In the many places where the two systems interact, you'll be collaborating closely with the Registry team's architect.

This is a hands-on coding role. Working with three other full-time www engineers and a designer, you'll be adding features to the www codebase, and spinning up new services to add functionality when necessary.

It's also a leadership role, in that you'll be leading by example. You'll be demonstrating best practices, refactoring older code, and when appropriate, building tooling to smooth the way. You'll review the contributions of other engineers, and share responsiblity for mentoring them. 

We're not looking for a shopping list of languages and technologies. We're looking for people who are smart and get stuff done, who have a track record of understanding complicated problems and solving them.

The npm website is [open source](https://github.com/npm/newww), so all your work on the main site will be, too.

Because this role relies on a great deal of human interaction to coordinate and collaborate with other teams, we are not accepting remote candidates for this role.
