# engineering manager, www team

[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) is growing quickly, with a million unique visitors every month and over 5MM page views. Having given it a totally new look and overhauled the backend over the last year, we launched [private modules](https://www.npmjs.com/private-modules) in April.

Now we have a ton of ambitious plans for it, including team-management features,  [curation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#collections) and [programmatic validation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#ecosystems) of packages, better stats, and significantly better search. We also have our [npm Enterprise](https://www.npmjs.com/enterprise) product, which needs a web experience all of its own.

All these plans require we grow the www team from its current size of two to five people (plus a full-time designer) in 2015, and grow even further in 2016. That means they need their own manager to keep the team informed, unblocked and happy.

We don't need the engineering manager to be the best engineer on the team -- the skills that make a great team leader are not the same ones that make for a great architect. However, a background in engineering, especially as a leader of teams, will be a big asset. 

We want somebody who is comfortable with the role of a manager as a force multiplier, who gets pleasure in seeing a team work smoothly together and release high-quality software. We want you to care about keeping engineers focused on code, applying just the right amount of process to minimize confusion without adding friction.

You will absolutely need to be a great communicator, good at juggling tasks and priorities. And you'll need to have the kind of big-picture oversight skills to spot tasks and bugs that are slipping through the cracks, and making sure they get tackled before they become a drag on team momentum.

The npm website is [open source](https://github.com/npm/newww), so the output of your team will open to the world, and handling contributions from external developers (people who don't work here regularly fix bugs in our website!) will also be your responsibility.

Because of the amount of face time involved in representing the team, we are not accepting remote applicants for this role. This will be based in our offices in Oakland, CA.
