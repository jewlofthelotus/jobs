# UX/UI designer

We have a website. It's really big, and quite pretty these days. Under the hood, we rebuilt it completely, launching that new version back in April, when we introduced private modules. But we're just getting started.

[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) gets a million unique visitors every month and over 5MM pageviews, and has grown 200% in the last 12 months. People use it to find new modules, to read the documentation, and now they use it to manage their private modules as well.

In the near future we're going to launch our Organizations feature, and our users will be able to manage teams and package permissions from the website too. Soon after that we're going to be adding a bunch of new features to make it faster and easier to find the right package, by adding [curation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#collections) and [programmatic validation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#ecosystems) of packages, both of which will give us the new data we need to enhance the all-important search experience.

These are chunky, challenging features, and we need somebody to help us design the best experience for our users. npm's philosophy is to reduce friction, so a user experience that is minimal and gets out of their way, with smart defaults and simple, obvious workflows, is what we need.

We know that UX and UI are different skill sets and different jobs, so we know we're asking for a lot when we say we want both, and all other things being equal we will lean towards people who are stronger UX designers, and have good product ideas. If there's more UI work than you can handle, we'll hire contractors to do design and you will be responsible for managing our relationship with them and approving their work.

We are *not* asking you to also be a developer: while you will be part of the engineering organization — because we believe design and engineering should collaborate closely — engineering skills are not a requirement of this job. If you like coding you are welcome to do it, but if you don't you can leave the HTML, CSS and JavaScript to the rest of the engineering team. However, we are a tool for developers, so somebody who understands developers and has worked on technical products before is going to be at an advantage.

This position will be based in our offices in Oakland, CA, and we are not looking for remote candidates for this position.
