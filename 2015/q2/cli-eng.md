Developers keep finding new ways to use Node, JavaScript, and npm: instead of just being a package manager for Node, npm is a tool in the web developer's toolbox – or a tool to support building out hardware projects – or a tool to help framework developers build out their own ecosystems. The npm command-line interface (CLI) is many developers' primary interface to the JavaScript universe. Your job will be to work with us to make it better.

Developers want npm to be easy to use, flexible enough to solve their problems with web and back-end development, and fast enough to stay out of their way. It's a big open-source project, and npm, Inc. has the good fortune to have not only a team of developers dedicated to maintaining it, but a lively and engaged community of contributors who help with everything, from support and documentation all the way through feature development.

Work on the CLI mostly happens in the open, and working on it is a great way to get paid to work as part of a thriving open-source community. The team [helps contributors get their patches merged](https://github.com/npm/npm/wiki/code-review-process) as well as working with the other teams at npm to support the rollout of new features on the registry and web site. There's never a shortage of things to do, but because there's a new CLI release [every week](https://github.com/npm/npm/wiki/Release-Process), the emphasis is on steady progress and shipping things when they're ready.

A typical week can include:
* helping users troubleshoot problems with npm in their development environments
* working on new features in the CLI
* reworking the CLI's internals to be easier to understand and maintain
* keeping other projects (Node.js, io.js, ember-cli, Angular) up to date on npm's progress
* walking users through their use cases and requirements and using that to figure out [which problems the CLI needs to tackle next](https://github.com/npm/npm/wiki/Roadmap).

It's incredibly rewarding and never boring. Almost every day you'll have an opportunity to make at least one npm user's life better, and improve the product as a whole in the bargain. Software development, release management, product management, developer support and evangelism, community management, and more are all parts of what we do from day to day. As we grow the team, we're looking to add people who want to take ownership of some of these roles, and who are versatile enough to find most of them interesting. npm is only going to get more important to web development over time, and this is a great opportunity to get paid to work on something that's useful to a whole lot of people.
