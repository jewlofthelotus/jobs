## Enterprise Engineer

npm currently generates revenue in two main ways: by hosting private packages on the public registry (our "SaaS" offering) and by licensing others to run the npm registry on their infrastructure (our "npm Enterprise" product). npm has built the largest software registry in the world, making it easy for millions of developers to share their software, and many enterprises want to bring this same solution and experience in-house, running on their servers, behind their firewall.

We've taken the many microservices and datastores that form the public registry and npm website, and, with the help of [Replicated](https://www.replicated.com), we packaged them up into a convenient Docker-based appliance. This makes it easy for any company, organization, or team to run their very own private registry using the same code as the public registry.

Traditionally, npm Enterprise has not been a top priority for npm as a company, but the product has taken off and become an integral part of everyday life for developers across several large corporations, and we're ramping up to make sure npm Enterprise gets the love it needs and deserves to sustain and grow the product. This is where _you_ come in.

We need a software engineer who wants to _own_ the npm Enterprise product, making sure it addresses our customers' needs and providing direction for the future growth of this commercial software. We need someone with a strong technical background who is willing to work one-on-one with our customers, teaching them how to use npm and helping them configure and maintain their npm Enterprise instances per their requirements.

Most npm microservices are written in Node, and npm Enterprise is Docker-based, so experience in these technologies is a plus. Some background in corporate networks/environments and familiarity with [different flavors of Linux](https://npme.npmjs.com/docs/up-and-running/requirements.html) would also help. However, we strongly believe that the best candidates are the ones that can learn quickly, be compassionate and productive, and are self-motivated - regardless of experience.

In joining the npm team, you'll become an important part of a small but talented engineering team, working in a fast-paced startup, where everyone wears many hats and everyone pitches in where needed. However, unlike many startups, we don't expect or want you to give up your personal life - npm strives to provide a sensible balance between work and non-work, and we allow you to define your own schedule. You'll be given the freedom and responsibility to make a significant impact, doing things as you see fit. You'll also get the chance to contribute to many of npm's open source projects.

Our headquarters are in downtown Oakland, California, but we have several remote wombats as well. We
cannot currently sponsor new work visas other than TN-1s, and we can
transfer existing H-1Bs.
