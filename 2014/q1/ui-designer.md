## UI Designer (contract)

We're greatly expanding the scope of our primary website, [npmjs.org](www.npmjs.org), with a focus on improving the experience for new users and enhancing package discoverability for experienced users. We're working with [Alexis Finch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisfinch), a kick-ass UX consultant, and you'll be working primarily with her to define and skin wireframes and improve the look-and-feel of our site, while staying true to its clean, simple aesthetic.

The ideal designer for this project has experience working with deeply technical, developer-focussed products, and is comfortable working as part of a small team. You'll be expected to work at least part of the time in-person at our offices in Oakland. The scope of the project is not fully defined yet but we anticipate a 2-3 month engagement.
