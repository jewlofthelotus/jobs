## Internships

If you're currently in full-time education and looking for a summer internship with an open-source project that can also pay you, we're happy to say that we can offer you a place at npm in partnership with our investors, as part of the [True Entrepreneur Corps](http://www.trueventures.com/tec/) program.

We are looking primarily for enthusiasm and intellectual curiosity, but any experience with Node.js is obviously a big advantage.

You'll be working on the open-source npm project itself, so your work will be code-reviewed by the same people who run the project, your commits will immediately benefit tens of thousands of active users, and will also be publicly verifiable by future employers.

Please include the word "internship" in your subject line if applying for this position. (NB: Regular applications for TEC are closed for 2014, but you can still apply via npm)
