Client Executive, Oakland, California
=================================================

Explosive Growth of the npm project
-----------------------------------
npm is an open-source package manager that wraps up modules of javascript code and makes it very easy to share that code.   Here’s some basic stats about the scope of the project:

* **94,000+** packages of javascript code published on npmjs.org
* **1,400,000+** developers regularly visit npmjs.org
* **13,000,000+** unique IP addresses have downloaded npm packages
* **450,000,000+** package downloads in the last month

npm is the package manager for node.js, bower, browserify, gulp.js, grunt.js, tessel.io and dozens of other major projects.

npm, Inc. was founded in Feb. 2014 to run the public npm registry and build a series of enterprise class solutions, including on-premise software and a forth coming SaaS tool.   These new private npm solutions will let developers use the open-source development tools they know and love in new ways that are secure and private.   npm prides itself on having a diverse team with a culture that is open, professional and tolerant. 

About the Role
--------------

The Client Executive owns the “demand” side of the business.   This is a high-volume inside sales role working with lots of in-bound leads.

npm’s significant popularity means there is a large flow of potential customers who show up every day asking for our on-premises software solution, npm Enterprise.   These potential customers need to be supported through a process that includes installing and testing the software, finalizing a licensing agreement and account activation.

Initially, the Client Executive will report to the COO.   Over time, the organization will grow and the company expects to hire executive sales leadership.
