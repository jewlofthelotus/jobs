# Dev *

Developer Advocate? Developer Empowerer? Developer Educator? We couldn't decide which name was best for this role, so we called it Dev * (pronounced "Dev Star").

npm is a product by software developers for software developers, and has millions of active users, with tens of thousands of new users turning up each and every day. To keep up with this explosive growth of our community and keep it growing, we need to make npm (and node.js in general) more accessible, easier to use, and much better documented.

Your job will be to grow the community by making it easier to join and faster to get productive. You'll do that by writing documentation, making tutorial vides, building prototypes and reference implementations, and bringing those out to the world, digitally and in person at conferences, hackathons and meetups. You'll also get feedback from real users and synthesize it into bug reports, feature requests and strategic direction to make our software and services better.

To do that you need to be a clear communicator, an excellent writer, and a willing public speaker (we were going to say "confident" but we've never met any confident public speakers). You should be happy learning and explaining complex technical matter, and a good enough developer to write clear examples and demo code. npm is primarily a node.js community, so experience with Node is important.

Because your role requires a lot of face time with every part of the team as well as real-world appearances, our ideal candidate for this role should be close to our offices in Oakland, California.
