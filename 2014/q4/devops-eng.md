# Devops Engineer

The npm registry serves half a billion downloads every month, with peak traffic over 2000 requests per second. In the last year npm Inc. has got uptime under control (better than 99.9% since April), so now it's time to build out new features without making any sacrifices in this hard-won reliability.

You'll be widening and deepening the feature set of the npm public registry and npm Enterprise (the same software powers both products). This includes stuff like private modules and support for organizations and teams in the registry itself, as well as awesome new npm website features like [collections and ecosystems]().

We're looking for an experienced engineer who understands the importance of maintainable code and comprehensive tests, and who values simple, composable services. We expect you to understand modern tools for source control, be comfortable working with a variety of data stores, and be familiar with deployment automation tools and principles.

We expect this role will be about 75% development, 25% operational tasks, so you need to be actively interested in getting operational stuff right, because we take our uptime very seriously.

The majority of your output will be open source code and we actively encourage you to develop and release open-source tooling that helps the broader node.js community; anything that helps node users helps us.

We are accepting remote candidates for this role but will give precedence to candidates who are local to our offices in Oakland, California, or at least in a nearby time zone.
