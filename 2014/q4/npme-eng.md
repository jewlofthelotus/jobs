# npm Enterprise Engineer

[npm Enterprise](https://www.npmjs.org/enterprise/) is the software that powers the public npm registry, condensed into an easy-to-maintain appliance that runs inside your network. Our customers use it to decrease latency, as well as satisfy stringent legal or security requirements, and to build fully-internal deployment automation.

Because npm Enterprise customers are installing our software into a variety of OS, hardware, network and security environments, there is often custom integration work that needs to be done to make them successful. Sometimes this is simply help with configuration, and sometimes it involves adding new features to npm Enterprise itself.

We're looking for somebody who likes talking to customers directly, via email, phone and video, teaching them how to use npm Enterprise well, and taking their pain-points and turning them into bug fixes and feature requests. You'll also be responsible for actively reaching out to customers who are trying out npm Enterprise to help them get started. Finally, you'll be implementing bug fixes and implementing new features for npm Enterprise, with the help of the rest of the devops team.

We think this role will be something like a 60/40 split between customer-facing interaction and writing code, so somebody who likes talking to people is essential, and you'll need some programming expertise. npm Enterprise is written entirely in Node.js, so experience with Node is a big plus.

In addition to helping our enterprise customers directly, npm Enterprise shares many components with the npm public registry, so your work on those pieces will be open-source and used by millions of people every day.

We are accepting remote candidates for this role, but most of our customers are in the US, so you will have to be comfortable working during US business hours.
