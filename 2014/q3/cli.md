## Very Good Developer (command line tools)

npm is the command-line interface to the npm ecosystem. It is battle-tested, surprisingly flexible, and used by hundreds of thousands of JavaScript developers every day. But it needs to do more!

We're in the process of making a number of long-overdue changes to npm to make it more flexible to use in third-party tooling, better at working with larger team development processes, and more optimized for the needs of the growing army of front-end developers using npm to do browser development. This is an excellent opportunity to improve and redesign parts of a tool that is very powerful. Your work *will* be noticed.

We're looking for developers who care deeply about package management, and care just as much about the developers who rely upon it. You'll be on a team of 2 directly reporting to one of npm's cofounders, so there won't be a lot to get in your way, but you'll also be dealing directly with npm's customers on a regular basis. Your work will be very visible, it will be open source, and there will be many opportunities to build new tools for use within npm.

We are willing to consider remote workers for this position, but are unable to process work visas other than TNs yet.
