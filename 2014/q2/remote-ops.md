## Remote operations engineer (part-time)

We work hard to make our system reliable and automate as much as possible, but sometimes you need a human to decide what to do, and sometimes you need that human in the middle of the night. This is a serious drain on the productivity of our team in California.

Luckily, the world is round, and it's not night-time everywhere at the same time. So we're looking for an operations engineer located in a time-zone far enough away that they can cover Pacific night time (UTC 0500 to 1500) with ease.

You'll be part of a team of two, working rotating 10-hour shifts, an average of 35 hours per week (some weeks 3 shifts, some weeks 4). Your job is simple: answer when PagerDuty calls, put out any fires, and clean up afterwards in a responsible way (document production changes, enact mitigation plans, etc.). If there are no fires during your shift, you are not required to do anything.

This is the perfect role for somebody looking for some extra cash to support bootstrapping a startup, funding travel, or any of the other fun things you can do with 3.5-day week. We're offering the same generous hourly rate regardless of location.
