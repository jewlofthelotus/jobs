## Job: Front-end developer

[www.npmjs.org](http://www.npmjs.org) serves 3 million page views to over half a million unique users every month, and traffic has grown more than 40% since the beginning of the year. This is despite the fact that it barely does anything! 

But we're fixing that, with a long-overdue [rebuild](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/88024339405/nearing-practical-maintainability) in the battle-tested [hapi](http://hapijs.com/) framework. That's going to be quickly followed by a complete visual refresh, already in progress. Those will lay the groundwork for a long laundry list of new features we have planned to help our users find, evaluate and learn how to use the best of the 80,000 packages in the registry.

We're looking for a developer who of course loves Node, but is also a big fan of CSS, and has a strong sense of design and usability. Your challenges will be about finding new and useful ways to search and display the registry, turning npmjs.org into the primary destination for people learning and using Node.js. Your work will be both highly visible and  [open source](https://github.com/npm/newww).

You'll be our second full-time front-end developer, working out of our offices in Oakland. For this position we are not looking for remote workers, and unfortunately our limited resources mean we cannot handle H-1B holders at this time (TN visas are okay).
