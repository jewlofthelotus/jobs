npm's traffic is already big (180 million package downloads in January) and growing incredibly quickly. We need to catch up with our growth, and then scale up ahead of it while building out the new features people keep asking for. This is going to require creative solutions, not just throwing up more boxes.

npm users are also relying on it in production, so we are taking operations seriously. We want push-button deploys, automated tests, and first-class instrumentation and monitoring, so alerts go off before things go wrong.

We like working at npm because our product is for developers, so we are our own customers, and all our engineers have a ton of influence on the shape of what we build. We find this makes us feel more connected to what we're doing, and motivated to get it right.

So we're looking for somebody who is 50/50 developer and operations, with a continuing interest in both fields. We're particularly interested in people with a background in deployment automation tools like Puppet, Chef, Fabric, or Salt. Experience with Node.js is obviously also good :-) You'll be joining our existing team of five engineers, two of whom are already dedicated to devops.

This role is based at our headquarters in Oakland, California, and we're not looking for remote candidates right now.
