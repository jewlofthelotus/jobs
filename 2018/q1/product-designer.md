# Senior Product Designer

## about npm

npm is the package manager for all JavaScript, serving code modules to
over 11 million developers around the globe. As a low-friction way to
share code, it has facilitated some of the largest open source
movements in web development. Since its invention in 2009, over
628,000 packages have been published. In 2018, nearly everybody who
builds a website uses npm to help them do it.

We believe that high-performing teams include people from different
backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions
with fresh perspectives. To that end, we actively seek a diverse pool
of applicants, including those from historically marginalized groups â€”
women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly
incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation
immigrants, and people from low-income families.

## our code of conduct

npm exists to facilitate sharing code, by making it easy for
JavaScript module developers to publish and distribute packages.  npm
is a piece of technology, but more importantly, it is a community.  We
believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is
friendly, safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment.
We do not tolerate abusive behavior.  See our unabridged code of
conduct [here](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct).

## about this role

You'll work closely with our head of product (who is also our CEO),
and with our engineering team as well as other major stakeholders like
marketing, sales, and support to improve current products and envision
new ones to add user value. You'll help define and clarify npm's
entire product suite as well as produce workflows, information
architecture, written product specs and wireframes as appropriate.

You'll be tasked with getting inside our users' heads, applying
empathy tactically to the puzzle of delivering a product vision within
the constraints of what's possible in reality. While you might not be
a software developer yourself, you are familiar with their experience
and the challenges they face.

Your first project will be to survey our website and smooth out the
journey from "brand new user" to "satisfied customer".  In the
fullness of time, you'll become the local guide to help make npm's
product experience more consistently organized, and presented to our
users in convenient, learnable web interfaces.

This position will be based in our offices in Oakland, CA, and we are
not looking for remote candidates for this position.  We cannot
currently sponsor new work visas other than TN-1s, but we can transfer
existing H-1Bs.

## you will love this role if you

- value collaboration and diverse perspectives
- enjoy brainstorming to define new products and improve existing ones
- enjoy web development work
- enjoy working with a variety of personal and professional styles
- value transparency
- value continuous growth
