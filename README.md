# jobs

The process to post a new job is:

1. Add your file to https://github.com/npm/jobs with a
   `<year>/<quarter>/<title>` name because an archive of previous jobs
   copy is nice and this is more convenient than digging through
   commit history.  (Use hyphens in the filename rather than spaces, so
   as to make terminal usage more convenient for those of us who edit
   in vim and emacs and do other things on the command line.)
2. Do some review with others at the company.
3. Post the job in Lever.
